# Population generator

## Introduction
This project was born for the need to create synthetic populations for another project.
While it Would be easy enught to make a one of datasett. 
I thought this might be a handy tool to have around for further projects.
As such I decided to take some time to work this out in a propper manner.

## Credit:
A large credit goes to https://github.com/thm/uinames. 
When looking for a name API this appeard berfect.
However it seems the API is down. 
Thankfully the name data I needed was still available.
I "borrowd" the data for this small project. 
And want to thank both Thom and all that have contirbuted to the list.
If this package gets a reasonal aomount of use outside personal use,
I will aim to make and Living API to host this to make it accsesible for others.
